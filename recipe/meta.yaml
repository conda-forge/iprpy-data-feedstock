  description: |
    The iprPy framework is a collection of tools and resources supporting 
    the design of scientific calculations that are open source with minimum 
    barriers for usage, have transparent methodologies supporting knowledge 
    transfer and education, produce results that are both human and machine 
    readable, allow investigations into method and parameter sensitivity, 
    and can be integrated into workflows
